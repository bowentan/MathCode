Hello, here is Bowen Tan. I'm currently a CS PhD student in City University of Hong Kong and mainly focus on algorithms and machine learning. The website is maintained to share some interesting mathematical/computational problems (Challenge), my LeetCode answers (LeetCode) and some practical experience (Practice) while coding. 

For LeetCode questions and problems when we are coding or managing software/servers, my solutions may not be the best ones but I hope they can help you to obtain some insights and get rid of your own ones.

Good luck and enjoy yourselves!
